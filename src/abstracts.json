    "text": "Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite capable of infecting any warm-blooded species and can increase risk-taking in intermediate hosts. Despite extensive laboratory research on theeffects of T. gondii infection on behaviour, little is understood about the effects of tox-oplasmosis on wild intermediate host behavior. Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA,has a diverse carnivore community including gray wolves (Canis lupus) and cougars (Puma concolor), intermediate and deﬁnitive hosts of T. gondii, respectively. Here, we used 26 years of wolf behavioural, spatial, and serological data to show that wolf territory overlap with areasof high cougar density was an important predictor of infection. In addition, seropositivewolves were more likely to make high-risk decisions such as dispersing and becoming a packleader, both factors critical to individual ﬁtness and wolf vital rates. Due to the social hier-archy within a wolf pack, we hypothesize that the behavioural effects of toxoplasmosis maycreate a feedback loop that increases spatial overlap and disease transmission betweenwolves and cougars. These ﬁndings demonstrate that parasites have important implicationsfor intermediate hosts, beyond acute infections, through behavioural impacts. Particularly in asocial species, these impacts can surge beyond individuals to affect groups, populations, andeven ecosystem processes"
